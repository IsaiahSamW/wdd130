            <img src="images/Massachusettsfinished.jpg" alt="Home state">
            <p>Massachusetts is my home. It is a green, rainy state on the east side of the US. It is full of trees, random bodies of water, and winding roads. It is one of the original thirteen colonies, and it has so much history.</p>
