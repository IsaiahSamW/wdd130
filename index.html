                <p>My name is Isaiah White. I don't really know what I'm doing, but I'm sure to get the hang of this... 
                I used to live in Tooele, Utah, but then we got the insparation to go to Massachusetts. We went and got a house in Agawam, Mass, and I love it here.
                I like reading and playing video games. I love the Stormlight Archieves by Brandon Sanderson (very good read, if you like long books) and playing
                Minecraft (which I do after finishing this classwork). Yes, that's me. I look very unhappy. Maybe because my dog was barking a lot. Maybe because 
                I have to take a photo of myself. Maybe because I have to write this gosh-darn paragraph for this to actually look good. And there's still more to 
                write! Storming website! I'm pretty sure there's a way for this to look good without having to right all this... But I'm going to do this the way the 
                teacher intended. So... Favorite song? The Road Goes Ever On and On by JRR Tolkien. It goes like this: The road goes ever on and on/ out from the door where it begain/ Now far ahead the road has gone/ and I must follow, if I can.
                Pursuing it with eager feet / until it joins some larger way/ where many paths and errends meet/ and wither then? I cannot say...
                </p>

                <p>Massachusetts is my home. It is a green, rainy state on the east side of the US. It is full of trees, random bodies of water, and winding roads. It is one of the original thirteen colonies, and it has so much history.</p>
